The dataset, comprising only 96 rows over a timespan of 1.98 days, is unsuitable for reliable time series forecasting due to its insufficient temporal coverage. Time series forecasting typically requires a minimum of 7 days of data to capture seasonal patterns, trends, and cyclical behaviors effectively. With such a limited dataset, any predictive model would likely be overfitted to the noise present in the data rather than capturing meaningful patterns, leading to unreliable forecasts.

To enhance the dataset for more robust forecasting, additional data collection efforts should focus on extending the timespan to at least several weeks or months. This would allow for the identification of trends and seasonal variations, which are crucial for accurate predictions. In the meantime, alternative analyses that could be performed on this limited data include descriptive statistics to summarize the data's characteristics, anomaly detection to identify outliers or unusual patterns, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize relationships and distributions within the dataset. These analyses can provide valuable insights even in the absence of sufficient data for forecasting.
