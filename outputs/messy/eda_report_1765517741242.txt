⚠️ **Data Quality Alert**

Negative power output detected: min=-0.499 (renewable energy systems must have power output >= 0)

**Issue:** The dataset contains negative power output values, which violates physical constraints for renewable energy systems. Solar and wind power generation must always be non-negative (≥ 0).

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Sensor calibration error:** Power sensors may need recalibration
2. **Data processing error:** Sign flip or unit conversion mistake during data export
3. **Incorrect column selection:** The target column may not represent actual power output

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Review and clean the raw data to remove or correct negative values
2. Verify sensor calibration and data export procedures
3. Confirm that the selected column represents actual power output (not delta/difference values)
4. Re-upload the corrected dataset

**Note:** Analysis cannot proceed with physically impossible data values. Please fix the data and try again.
